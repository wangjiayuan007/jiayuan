### Automatic  Road Extraction from Satellite Images

- Implemented a method that consists of image segmentation by CNN(U-Net) and centerline extraction.
-  Conducted experiments on datasets from [Spacenet challenge]{https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/Challenges/Challenge-3.html}. Scores are higher than the winner’s with better connections and less noise.
- Developed a novel framework without labelled data by applying the graph reconstruction algorithm iteratively to improve the accuracy of the CNN.

### Ridge extraction from density field with discrete Morse theory

- Designed the first noise model and proved the theoretical guarantee for a ridge extraction algorithm.
- Applied the algorithm to reconstructing road networks from GPS trajectories/satellite images, extracting the filament structures from the cosmology data/biomedical images of neurons and bones, and simplifying lines for rough sketches.

### Outlier removal for point clouds

- Implemented a parameter-free denoise algorithm for arbitrary dimensions. The result is guaranteed to be Hausdorff close to the ground truth.
- Removed outliers for 2D/3D generated by uniform/adaptive sampling. Improved classification error from 4.09% to 2.45% on mislabeled handwritten digits in which each image is a high dimension point.
