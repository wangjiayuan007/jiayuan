            I am a phd candidate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the Ohio State University. 
            I am co-advised by Prof. <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~dey.8/">Tamal Dey</a> and 
            Prof. <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.1016/">Yusu Wang</a>. 
            My research focuses on data analysis via computational geometry/topology with applications
            in machine learning, computer vision, visualization and graphics. More specifically, I work on
            processing noisy datasets in the following scenarios: Removing outliers from point clouds and recovering
            signals from density fields. Before coming to OSU, 
            I obtained my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Zhejiang University in 2014.
